# RedditImageScrapper
RIS is program that takes images from reddit page choosen by user and showing them in nice looking way.
Program lets user save image links as bookmarks or download them. Used: Java8, JavaFX, SQLite3, HtmlUnit and JSOUP.

Features:
  - Imgur, DeviantArt, gfcat videos, tumblr posts, reddituploads.
  - Imgur, tumblr and DeviantArt can be showed as albums.
  - program can recognize and open any file with extensions: .mp4, jpg, png, gif. Of course only if files are linked in reddit. I planned adding bookmarks from external links, but for now i don't have really time for that
